Patrick Bateman's madness is the last bit of sanity in him.

Think about it. The film would be more disturbing if he **_wasn't_** a deranged murderer!

This is what makes the ending of the film so brilliant; whether he did in fact commit the murders or not is moot because **no one cares**.
To be denied the ultimate happiness of the knife---his supreme moment of self-judgement---is the final blow to Patrick Bateman:

> There are no more barriers to cross.
> All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed.
> My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone.
> In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others.
> I want no one to escape.
> But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis; my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.
> No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling.
> This confession has meant nothing.

He did not mean to be ashamed of his madness.
